<h1><center> SINGLETON </center></h1>

 The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access to that instance.
 This pattern is particularly useful when you need to manage shared resources or data across multiple instances of a class.
 
### Benefits of the Singleton Pattern


- Resource management: The Singleton Pattern ensures that resources or shared data are managed consistently across different parts of your application.
Global access: By providing a global point of access to the Singleton instance, you can easily reference the object from different parts of your code.
Unique instance: Ensuring that only one instance of a class exists prevents duplicate instances and potential conflicts.


### When to Use the Singleton Patter

- The Singleton Pattern is ideal for managing shared resources like configuration data, caches, or connection pools.
 Itâ€™s also useful for ensuring that specific services or components within your application maintain a single instance, 
 improving consistency and reducing potential conflicts.
 



### Here are some real-life examples of how the Singleton pattern is used:

- Logging: A logger object is often implemented as a singleton to ensure that there is only one instance of it in the application. This makes it easier to manage logging operations and ensures that log messages are always written to the same file.

- Database connections: A database connection manager is often implemented as a singleton to ensure that there is only one open database connection at a time. This can help to improve performance and reduce resource usage.

- Configuration: A configuration object is often implemented as a singleton to make it easy to access application configuration settings from anywhere in the code.

- Printing: A print spooler object is often implemented as a singleton to manage the printing of documents. This ensures that print jobs are processed in order and that multiple documents can be printed simultaneously.

- Session management: A session manager object is often implemented as a singleton to manage user sessions. This makes it easier to track user activity and ensure that users are properly authenticated and authorized.
