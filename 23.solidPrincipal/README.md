# Design Patterns In Javascript

- Design patterns are tried-and-true solutions to recurring problems that software developers encounter during their coding journey. They provide a structured approach to solving challenges and promote best practices in software architecture. By incorporating design patterns, developers can create more robust, maintainable, and extensible codebases.
## Why Design Patterns Matter in Node.js
- Node.js, known for its non-blocking event-driven architecture, presents unique challenges and opportunities in software design. Applying design patterns tailored to Node.js can lead to more efficient and optimized applications. Letâ€™s explore some key design patterns that are particularly valuable in the Node.js ecosystem:

### Creational Design Patterns
- Singleton Pattern - TBD
- Factory Pattern - TBD
- Observer Pattern - TBD
- Middleware Pattern - TBD
- Module Pattern - TBD
- Decorator Pattern - TBD
- Dependency Injection pattern - TBD

### Behavioural Design Patterns

- Publisher/Subscriber Pattern - TBD
- Strategy Pattern - TBD
- Observer Pattern - TBD
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern - TBD
- Mediator Pattern - TBD
- Iterator Pattern - TBD

### Structural Design Patterns

- Facade Pattern - TBD
- Decorator Pattern - TBD
- Adapter Pattern - TBD
- Composite Pattern - TBD
